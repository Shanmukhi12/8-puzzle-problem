# 8-puzzle-problem
This project implements the A* algorithm to solve the classic 8-puzzle problem. The 8-puzzle is a sliding puzzle that consists of a 3x3 grid with 8 numbered tiles and one blank space. The objective is to rearrange the tiles from their initial state to a goal state by sliding them into the blank space. The A* algorithm efficiently finds the optimal solution for this problem by intelligently exploring the state space.

Problem Formulation
Goal: The goal state is given by the user as a input initially
States: Represents the individual locations of tiles
Actions: The blank tile can be moved up, right, left and down directions
Performance: The total moves taken to achieve the desired states
